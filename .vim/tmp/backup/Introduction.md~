##What is Economics?

Objectives:

### What kinds of questions does economics address?

* The sources of all economics problems is _scarcity_

* _Economics_ is the social science that deal with the allocation of limited resources to satisfy unlimited human wants

* _Microeconomics_: focuses on the choices that individual and businesses
    * e.g.: how will a change in price of beer affect your demands

* _Macroeconomics_: focus on the choices and performance of the national economy - aggregate value
    * e.g.: how will a tax increase affect economic growth

### What are the principles of how people make 

####Principle 1: People Face Trade offs
* People will make choices
* There is a trade off because of resource limitations

Important trade off: efficiency vs equality
* _Efficiency_: Getting a maximum possible output in a system for a given input
    * Everyone receiving based on how much is produce
* _Equality_: Everyone getting the same amount

* If equality is pursued then efficiency suffers and vice versa

####Principle 2: The Cost of Something is What You Give Up To get it
* Making decision requires comparing the costs and benefits of alternative choices
* The _opportunity cost_ of any item is whatever must be given up to obtain it
    * It is difficult because you must consider what you spend **BUT** also what you lost by choosing this opportunity
    * Most people only consider explicit costs but implicit cost must be considered
* Even things without an _explicit monetary_ cost are not truly "free" because they have an _opportunity cost_
    * Therefore the following statement is not true:
>The best things in life are free.

####Principle 3: Rational People Think at the Margin
* Make decisions by evaluating costs and benefits of marginal changes
    * _Marginal changes_: incremental adjustments to an existing plan

####Principle 4: People respond to Incentives
* _Incentive_: price of benefit for carrying out a certain activity
    * something that induces a person to act i.e. reward or punishment

* Rational people respond to incentives

###What are the principles of how people interact

####Principle 5: Trade can make everyone better off
* Rather than being self-sufficient, people can specialize in producing one good or service and exchange it for other goods
* Countries also benefit from trade & specialization

####Principle 6: Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity
* _Market_: a group of buyers and sellers (needs not be in a single location)
* "Organize economic activity" means determining
    * What goods to produce?
    * How to produce them
    * how much of each to produce
    * who gets them
* In a market economy is growth happens because people are motivated to work harder to get things that they want
* Market Failure causes:
    * government taxation
    * monopoly/market power i.e. you can determine your price
    * _externalities_: external factors that affect a party that did not choose to be affected
        * It is can negative and positive
        * _positive example_: technology, vaccination
        * _negative example_: pollution

####Principle 7: Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes
* Prevent monopolies
* enforce property rights
*

####Principle 8: A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods & services
* Huge variation in living standards across countries and over time
* The most important determinant of living standards: productivity, the amount of goods and services produced from each hours of a worker's time
* Productivity depends on the equipment, skills and technology available to workers
* Other factors have far less impact on living standards
    * e.g. labour unions, competition form abroad

_Factors that are used to judge a standard of living_:
* GDP/Capita
* Health
    * Infant/Child Mortality Rate
    * Life expectancy
* Education
    * Literacy Rate

* Access to clean water
* Access to power
* Crime
* Fertility Rate
* Employment Rate
* Inflation Rate
* Political Freedom
* Technology
* Gini Coefficient

####Principles 9: Prices rise when the government prints too much money
* _Inflation_: increases in the general level of prices
In the long run, inflation is almost always caused by excessive growth in the quantity of money, which causes the value of money to fall.

####Principles 10: Society faces a short-run trade off between inflation and unemployment
