#The Concept of Stress

##Introduction

External Forces: Applied load, reactions, weight...
* Traction forces: applied over an area (bodies in contact)
* Body forces: act on all particles over the volume
    * f: N/mm^3
    * f = pb
        * b: N/kg
        * p: density


Internal Forces: Internal shear, internal moments...
*

##What is Stress?

* Stress is the **intensity** of the **internal force** at a **point**
* The intensity (stress) is found by taking the ratio of force over area

* The equivalent single force has three components
* Component perpendicular to the section is called axial or normal
* Component tangent to section is called shear or tangent
