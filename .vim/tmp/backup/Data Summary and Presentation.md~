Descriptive Statistics - part of statistics concerned with describing, summarizing data

GOAL:
* Focusing on important features
* Provide insight for analysis


##Summary of Data (mean and variance)

_Finite Population_ - countable
_Conceptual Population_ - infinite/ not countable

###Mean

Sample Mean
Xbar = sum of all elements in sample / n 
n = # in sample

Population mean
μ = sum of all elements in population / N
N = # in population


###Variance

Sample Variance
s^2= sum((x_i - Xbar)^2)/(n-1)

Population Variance
ο^2= sum((x_i - μ)^2)/N

_Why the difference in denominator?_
* X_i(observation) tends to be closer to Xbar than to μ
* (x_i - Xbar)^2 < (X_i - μ)^2
    * Then divided by n-1 to compensate
