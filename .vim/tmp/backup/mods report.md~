##Obstacles of Construction
As it can be expected from working with manual tools without apparatus that allow for greater accuracy, there were quite a few challenges that arose in the construction process. One of the issues that was evident even before the construction had started was that the holes that were being drilled needed to have a slight axis to them since one end of the cantilever had to be six centimetres wide whereas the other end was expected to be only two or three centimetres apart. Furthermore, the situation would have been easier to deal with if the holes that were drilled with the hand drill yielded near-perfectly straight holes, but that too was a best case that would have been difficult to achieve due to human error. The effects of this problem could only be spotted once the cantilever was fully assembled, usually resulting in structure that was asymmetrical.
Another issue that came about due to the uncertainty of the hand drill was the positioning of the holes. One way this issue was attempted to be addressed was by first drilling a hole in one piece of wood in its respective location, then stacking the drilled wood on top of an identically sized piece of wood, aligning the sides as precisely as possible. Next, having the stack taped together, drilling through the hole to create an alignment that would be as accurate as possible. This method did have a flaw in it that made the construction of the cantilever bridge looser if executed carelessly, which was that the hole that was being used as the reference, to make the other hole more precisely aligned, may become enlarged in the process.
An obstacle occurred due to the lack of tools was when the integrity of the structure relied on the pin support dowel, which had to support the rest of the truss and the load attached to the other end. To fix this, three dowels were glued together in a triangular shape to essentially create a dowel with greater cross sectional area. However, with the creation of a thicker, more strain-tolerant dowel, a bigger hole needed to be drilled in the wood. Due to the lack of a bigger drill bit, the creating the bigger hole was attempted by drilling a hole with the hand drill, then chipping off the sides of the hole until an appropriately sized hole came about. Although the issues mentioned above were magnified through this method of enlarging the hole, the problem was resolved by making the holes a bit bigger than the dowels so that the dowels could be more free to adjust for symmetry. Then once the position was set, a more tight fitting piece was added to fix the position that allowed for a symmetrical design. This process of chipping away wood being time-inefficient, a drill bit of the correct size was borrowed, but using the correctly size drill bit resulted in the wood splitting in half. Not wanting to risk losing more resources, the former method was used to fit the rest of the bigger sized holes.
