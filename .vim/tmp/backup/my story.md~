##Jan 10 (Sat)
Today is the due date for the KCF retreat.
I've had second thoughts about whether I should sign up or not but I've made my decision a few months ago, to go to PennApps with my friends.

##Jan 11 (Sun)
Today I had church and after church, like we always do we went to eat, I got shawarma and brought it over to McDonald's where everyone else was. After talking for some time, they started to talk about how good the small group leaders' small group was. I listened more Youngho invited everyone to the first small group leaders' meeting saying how we could come if we were still trying to decided whether we wanted to come or not. After some thinking and with some hope that I actually did want to be a small group leader, I decided to go to the meeting. The small group meeting was good, but after the small group I wanted to talk to Youngho afterwards. I pulled aside Youngho and Gloria to tell them where I was spiritually. I explained to them where I was in terms of Christianity. I explained to them how I hated God and how bitter I felt towards Him. I explained myself by telling them my past. I Don't remember much, but I do remember telling them a lot but not a lot of soul went into what I told them. I felt very repetitive, because at that point I told quite a few people my story and it felt very watered down.
After a few hours of telling them a story that made me feel like a broken record, Youngho concluded that I should go to the retreat. He and Gloria were quite adamant on my going to the retreat, which at this point wasn't even a thing I was considering. After 30 minutes of me saying 'no' and them asking if I was going to the retreat or not, we parted because it was getting late and my last answer to them was a 'I'll think about it'.

##Jan 12 (Mon)
I think about whether I want to go to the retreat or not for some time. I ask my sister whether I should go or not to and fro the registrar's office. I needed to get something done for RESP. I remember her telling me after a few minutes of me just thinking at her, to do what gives me comfort and peace. She also told me that she doesn't know whether I should go or not to the retreat but I shouldn't be relying on retreats for spiritual highs and neither should I be thinking that retreats are where I get my periodic dose of God. She was right and when I got back to residence, I remember sitting down at my chair and thinking/saying 'OK, I'm not going to the retreat and that's final'. But 30 minutes after saying that the thought of me going to the retreat came back. I sighed. I thought more and more and I took these thoughts to sleep. I woke up the next morning for class (which this term I didn't do much of) and I went to class. Frustratingly the one day that I decide to go to class was the day when I bogged by the dilemma of whether I should go to the hackathon or the retreat. I knew I was going to enjoy myself I went to PennApps but I also knew that if I went to the retreat I would learn something. At that time I was expecting something small from the retreat, but I couldn't have known what was in store for me. I finally tell myself that I will ask Ashley Chan, one of the contacts that was available in the Facebook event. I told myself that if she would let me go, in spite the fact I was 3 days late for the due date, then I will go. I thought this knowing almost certainly that she would say yes, although I shouldn't have thought like that but in my mind I actually thought 'obviously she'll say yes, it's a retreat'. I sent a Facebook message and an email. After this I felt peace, and I knew that this was what I needed to do. Something wasn't going to leave me alone until I decided to go. To be honest, I should have seen that fact that I was being bombarded with reasons not to go and feeling uncomfortable with not going [to the retreat] as a sign that there was something good in store for me at the retreat that the enemy didn't want to experience, but I guess I brushed it off. In a few hours she replied and progress started to happened for the goal of getting me on the list of attendees.

##Jan 16 (Fri)
I went to the retreat and I said hi to a bunch of people and Pastor Lisa spoke. Being exhausted I tried my best to not fall asleep.Embarrassingly, that is mostly all that I can remember of that night.

##Jan 17 (Sat)
According to Alicia, all the messages at this retreat was super blessed and just worked out really well(one message complimented another well and felt like a good sequence of messages), but to be honest I don't remember a single sermon or message. All the messages went through one ear and out the other....

It was the evening session, and the praise for that night was unorthodox. The praise team would sing one praise song and there would a monologue and this repeated a few times. After the praise there was a message from Josh. A few minutes before Josh's message was about to end I went to the back of the room. I wanted to talk to Pastor Lisa but she was talking to David, so I waited my turn. Around when she was done with David, it was the time for the love feast. I asked Pastor Lisa if I was allowed to take part in the love feast and she explained to me the nature of what a love feast is. How a love feast was different from communion, in the sense that it was an open invitation for anyone who wants of a taste of Christ to take part in the feast. I wanted to know if some one who hated God could take part in the love feast. She answered partly before having to leave to bless the love feast up on the stage and she told me that we can talk after the blessing of the love feast. She came back and I remember that I was beside a long pole. I forgot how the conversation got there, but I remember telling Pastor Lisa that I felt pathetic and disgusting. I did feel pathetic and disgusting for not feeling worthy enough to approach the table of the love feast, but I guess Pastor Lisa interpreted it as my struggle with pornographic materials. I don't know why, but even though that wasn't what I had in mind I still started to cry when I thought about my lust. After a lot of tears, and Pastor Lisa praying for me and giving me words of encouragement, she offered to go up to the love feast together. We got our hands washed by the KCF alumnus and got some bread and dipped it in to the grape juice. When we sat to take part in the communion, I couldn't bring myself to bring the bread up to my mouth. I simply felt unworthy. I just burst in a lot of tears and wondering how someone like me could take part in a feast like this. But at the same time my thought went through the vastness of God's love for allowing someone like me to take part in a feast like this. After 10-20 minutes, I finally brought the courage the eat the bread. This moment felt like my first communion. Even though, I've done the motion many times, there was something different about this communion that felt real. It was also momentous occasion for the fact that I stopped partaking in communion because I knew my heart wasn't in the right place and I didn't want to the taint that which was holy. 

Though not having received the answers that I wanted, I thought that this was what God had in store for me in the retreat... 
I was very wrong.

##Jan 18(Sun)

I got up that morning late for breakfast. I got my plate of breakfast and I looked for a place to eat. I saw a free seat where Ben Han and Josh Chun were sitting and since I haven't sat with them for any meal through out the retreat I thought it would be good for me to sit with them. I soon realized that the conversation they were having was about Ben's spiritual life. I remembered Gloria telling me that I should talk to Ben when telling her about my story last Sunday. After Ben finished his story, I gave a basic recall of what happened with me and let them know that I went through something similar. But as I was telling them, I just remembered how hard the last year had been and started to cry. Afterwards, Ben asked me if it was okay if one of the staff workers prayed for me. I said yes with a hesitant heart because I don't like it when someone prays for me after knowing my situation, it makes it seem very pitiful. After the breakfast, there was praise. After the praise, as the message was going to start Ben asked me if it was okay if we prayed. I was starting to wonder when we would pray if we have to leave after the message. Thinking that the prayer was going to be short I said yes. There were four of us. Allison (the waterloo/laurier staff worker), Josh Chu, Ben and myself. Josh left in the middle and someone else took his place, but that not really all that important. I first took the time to tell everyone where I was and where I am. I was extremely honest, to the point where I told them that I didn't feel genuine when telling them my story because I've told quite a few people the same thing and that I just felt repetitive at that point. I also told them that I don't expect much out of the prayer and expect it to be like any other short prayer.

###The Prayer:

I don't remember everything that happened but I will try to write about everything that I can remember.
At first the prayer started with Allison praying if Jesus could make His presence known to me. And as she was praying for this I felt a presence above us that felt like someone was watching us and listening to us pray. As everything was happening I told everyone in the group. From this point on when I say Allison, I actually mean everyone, but I directed most of my talking at Allison but everyone in the group heard it. So then I told Allison that my mind felt very cluttered with thoughts and that I couldn't focus because my head felt so full of thoughts, and I asked her if she could pray for this. And again as she started to pray I remember so distinctly and vividly how I felt something 'grabbing' my thoughts and pulling them from the back of my head and how thoughts disappeared from the front of my head to the back. I then tested by putting thoughts in there to see if it was really happening but every thought that I put in my head just ended up disappearing. I told Allison what was happening and she was amazed as I was. I don't remember exactly what we prayed, but I remember telling Allison that I felt like I had Jesus' full attention even though the room was full of people. I distinctly remember feeling that I felt like I was the only person in the world that Jesus was listening to and all His attention was on me. And shortly afterwards I had a strong feeling that Jesus was saying to me that He loved me. I don't remember when exactly but I just remember crying a lot.

I don't remember everything but I feel like Allison's recount of what happened is solid:
"I don't remember exactly what you prayed or what we asked next, but I remember that you were very moved physically. It was very clear that the Holy Spirit was doing something as you were quite upset and your body was in a very different posture than when we started. After some time like this I asked if you could tell us what was happening for you and you said "I'm just so angry" and there was more time of release of emotions. Again, this felt very much led by the Holy Spirit. I think after some time we reminded you that Jesus was big enough to handle all your anger and that you had his full attention." and as I read this I remember how I was and a bit of what I was doing.

"But at some point I think we prayed for for freedom and to be filled with peace  and you immediately said you felt different"
I felt in the beginning when I felt angry and bitter that there was some kind of greasy, oily and dirty fluid in my heart, but after we prayed for peace, I felt it being drained away from my heart. However even after this I remember there being a residue, and as we prayed for this I got the answering saying that it was going to be painful to get rid of the residue because the bitterness was in me for such a long time that it was going to take 'scrubbing' in order to get rid of the rest. I felt really happy about this not because of the upcoming pain, but because I knew about the pain that was about to come. It is a lot easier to deal with a pain that you know if coming and if you know God will be by your side as you go through the pain.

I also remember that I was scared that this was experience was going to be something that happens and I just forget in a week. So Allison prayed for peace, and a sense of His love and presence and for protection. And the prayer ended like that. Through out the entire prayer I felt like Jesus standing in between Allison and the seat where Josh and Minsoo sat.

When I asked Allison about she remembered about the prayer she concluded with this which gave me encouragement:
"Tommy, I will say again, that was honestly one of the most powerful experiences of prayer that I have been a part of. I was absolutely amazed at the work of the Holy Spirit and how Jesus made his presence known. That reminder of his presence right there with us has stayed with me and continues to be a powerful reminder to me of his presence. I was also SO moved by how anything it seemed we asked for in prayer God answered before we had even finished asking. Time and time again we would pray "help Tommy to have a sense of your presence" or "what are you saying to him" etc. and almost every time immediately you had a clear sense of his presence or what was being said. And everything you said that you thought you heard or sensed seemed right to me with what I know about who God is. I was SO moved by how he spoke to you and made himself known, it was really incredible! If you want to talk any more about this or meet up for coffee sometime let me know. It truly was an honour to pray for you that day. I hope that you are doing well and continuing to know that "you have his full attention." "

###The Aftermath

So the evening of the last day of the retreat, as I was typing up everything that had happened in the retreat, I had a chat with Youngho. One thing led to another and we ended chat on bad terms. I simply wanted to tell him that I wasn't ready. I told myself back then that it was because I wasn't ready, but I think it was simply because I didn't want to have to give up hackathons for the small group leaders' small group. So I just got annoyed at Youngho and ended up accusing him of accusing me of having wrong intentions (which was correct if I look back now). And the funny thing is that I knew that the enemy was going to work against me to break down everything that had happened at the retreat, and was conscious about it as the chat was going but I simply refused to fight what I felt was my "right" to be angry at Youngho. Also, just before the chat started, I accidentally didn't save what I was writing by pressing "Don't Save" when Microsoft Word prompted me to save, so I simply didn't continue because I was too pissed off.

##Feb 28 (Sat)

It was the night of the keunbit hangout. Alicia and I shared a cab and we had started a talk about the retreat and our spiritual lives. The conversation continued on in her house and as we shared what we went through throughout the years, Alicia shared to me what she learnt before the retreat, which was how God has already done 99.9 percent of the work and we we're just here waiting for stuff to happen and God to bless us, when in reality all we need to do to get the blessings is to claim it, aka the 0.1 percent of work. What she was talking about wasn't salvation by work but rather that God doesn't entertain laziness. After this night I tried to read the Bible intentionally. It didn't last too long.

##Mar 7 (Sat/ Fluid Conference)

This day I took the courage to tell Jacob of my struggle with pornography and the things written in Hebrews. I was wondering what it meant for me, someone who kept on returning to the sin. I thought that Jacob had been done with watching pornographic stuff for some reason, which made it harder for me to confess to him, but through my confession we decided to become accountable to each other.

##Mar 17

I tell Jacob it hasn't been going well

##Mar 29 (Sun)

Jacob out of the blue tells me that we need to become really serious about this. And we do.

##Apr 22 (Wed/Today)

I continued this part the next day, so its technically "Yesterday"

##Apr 30 - May 6 (Mark Central)

##May 8(Friday/ York Region Harvest Praise Night)

##May 9(Saturday)

I stepped out because I couldn't stand the smell of weed and I needed to get fresh air. Jacob followed me asking if everything was OK. I just told him what was happening, with my sensitivity to the smell of weed. He started the conversation with "I'm going to take next year off". And immediately, I told the same. He asked me what I was planning on doing, I told him "I dunno, but missions". I just told him that I've considered what he told me before about how by the time we graduate out of university we'll have more pressure to be stable in our lives and on top of that, I will have spend one third of my twenties in school and I wanted to do something for God with my youth. My sister also told me that employers look at individuals differently if they've taken a year off of school in the middle of university verses after university, and they tend to favour the former more. Then he told me, what he was planning on doing the Liz Hong's dad and the mission work that he was doing. When he started to talk about it, it immediately appealed to me, the only fear being that it might seem like I was just following what Jacob was doing. I told him my fear about that, but he told me that it's not about him, and also that it wasn't like his position in this plan was secured. And I told him that I felt like I was learning so much in the past few months and how I didn't know if I was able to process everything. Jacob immediately affirmed and referred me back to what he had told me before, about how the spirit was willing but the flesh is weak. And at one point while talking to him I realized that the issue I had yesterday at the York Region Harvest Church was about me and my hardened heart. And I told Joy, and as I was telling her I had a thought of God fixing this problem of mine, my absence of compassion, next year during my year off. And I am now thinking as I write this that I might be fixed while seeing God work, in the same way Peter was healed of his heart when Jesus healed the blind man.
